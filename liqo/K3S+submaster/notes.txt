PC master -> laptop slave
laptop submaster -> laptop docker slave
install liqo on 1st cluster 
-> problem on both clusters
1st -> liqo doesn't install completly (some pods are on pending)
2nd -> metrics-server/traefik/core-dns crash
---------------------------------
PC master -> laptop slave
install liqo on 1st cluster OK
laptop submaster 
problem on 1st cluster liqo-capsule-controller-manager -> Liveness probe failed: Get "http://10.42.1.6:10080/healthz": context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
2nd -> OK
-> laptop docker slave -> OK
install liqo on 2nd cluster -> Acees problem to 2nd cluster
Access to 2nd cluster via dockerized slave -> no access
Destroy slave -> access moved to submaster but still not work
GATEWAY ON SAME MACHINE ? (laptop slave and submaster) -> seems that the ghateway port can be configured maybe change it ? 
same probleme if no slave on 2nd cluster
