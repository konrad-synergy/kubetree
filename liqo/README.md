# Purpose
Those tests aim to use Liqo in the Kubetree architecture
## K3S + K3D
Combine a K3S and a K3D cluster. <br />
Trunk = K3S's master <br />
Branch = K3S's agent combined with K3D's master <br />
Leaf = K3D's agent
## K3S + submaster
Use my previous work on containerized submasters in a classical K3S cluster
